                {/* My research interests focus on <strong>human–AI interaction for supporting human creativity</strong> to
                achieve better cognitive support and creative collaboration, by designing interaction forms and
                generating contents that align with human intention, emotion, and cognition. */}

                My research focuses on <strong>human–AI alignment</strong>, exploring how AI systems can acquire and represent <strong>human expertise</strong> to better support <strong>creative work</strong>. Specifically, I study how tacit and subjective forms of human knowledge, such as aesthetic judgment, design principles, and creative reasoning, can be incorporated into <strong>large language models and agentic systems</strong>.
